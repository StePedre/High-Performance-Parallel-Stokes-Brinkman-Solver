## Overview

**NSBSolver** is a high-performance parallel **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** solver for the simulation of **incompressible Stokes–Brinkman equations**.  
It is designed as a computational kernel for **topology optimization** problems in **thermal management** for **Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)** applications.

The solver is written in modern **C++17** and targets **distributed-memory HPC systems**, leveraging **MPI** parallelism, **direction splitting**, and a **Schur-complement-based domain decomposition** strategy.

## Features

### Physics & Numerical Methods
- **Equations**: Incompressible Stokes–Brinkman
- **Geometry handling**: Fixed-grid approach inspired by the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) using porosity penalization
- **Spatial discretization**:  
  - Second-order asymmetric **MAC finite-difference** stencil
- **Temporal discretization**:  
  - **Crank–Nicolson** scheme  
  - **Douglas direction splitting** (unconditionally stable)

### Linear Solvers & Algorithms
- Custom **TDMA (Thomas algorithm)** for tridiagonal systems
- **Schur complement method** for parallel domain decomposition
- Explicit decoupling of interior nodes and inter-subdomain interfaces

## High-Performance Computing

- **Parallel model**: MPI with Cartesian topology
- **Domain decomposition**: Overlapping subdomains
- **Memory optimization**:
  - Persistent allocation strategy
  - Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) layout for vector fields
- **Communication**:
  - Non-blocking halo exchanges
- **Performance** (laptop environment):
  - Near-linear strong scaling for low core counts  
  - Measured speed: ≈ **0.48 μs per cell-step**  
  - Speedup at 4 cores: **S₄ ≈ 3.3**

## Limitations & Future Work

Current limitations include:

- **Convective term**: Not yet included (architecture already supports extension)
- **Boundary conditions**:
  - Supported: Dirichlet (velocity), Neumann (pressure)
  - Missing: Fully periodic BCs
- **Memory layout**:
  - Fields stored as separate objects  
  - Future improvement: single contiguous memory block to reduce TLB misses
- **I/O**:
  - Output currently distributed across MPI ranks  
  - Future improvement: use better formats (e.g., .VTP)
- **Scalability**:
  - Tested up to 8 MPI ranks only (laptop environment)  
  - Further testing on HPC clusters needed

## Validation

The solver has been validated through:

1. **Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS)**  
   - Verified second-order accuracy in space and time

2. **Canonical Laminar Flows**
   - Couette–Poiseuille flow
   - Hagen–Poiseuille flow with Brinkman penalization for circular geometries

3. **Scalability Tests** (laptop environment!)
   - Near-linear strong scaling up to 4 MPI ranks
   - Robust weak scaling on distributed grids
